## **System Architecture**
The architecture consists of five layers: **User Interface (UI), Backend, Machine Learning (ML), Image Processing, and Database.**

### **1. User Interface (Frontend)**  
   - **Purpose**: Provides an intuitive and responsive interface for farmers, exporters, and plantation managers.  
   - **Technologies**:  
     - **Frontend Framework**: React or Next.js for dynamic UI and SSR/SSG capabilities.  
     - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for modern, responsive design.  
     - **State Management**: Redux or Context API for efficient state handling.  
     - **APIs/Integration**: Axios or Fetch API for data fetching.  
   - **Features**:  
     - Dashboard showing foreign exchange predictions.  
     - Visualized data (charts, graphs) using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.  
     - Image upload interface for tea leaves disease detection.  
     - Export insights and market trends.

### **2. Backend**
   - **Purpose**: Manages APIs, handles requests, and serves as a bridge between the frontend and machine learning models.  
   - **Technologies**:  
     - **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js (lightweight and fast).  
     - **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.  
     - **API Design**: REST or GraphQL for efficient data exchange.  
   - **Services**:  
     - Endpoint to query ML models for predictions.  
     - Data validation and preprocessing (before sending to ML pipelines).  
     - Integration with image processing service for disease prediction.

### **3. Machine Learning Services**
   - **Purpose**: Handles the core ML functionality like predictions for production, markets, prices, and disease identification.  
   - **Technologies**:  
     - **Programming Language**: Python for its extensive ML ecosystem.  
     - **Frameworks**:  
       - **For ML Models**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn.  
       - **For Deployment**: Flask or FastAPI (for exposing ML models as APIs).  
       - **For Time-Series Analysis**: Prophet or ARIMA (for foreign exchange prediction).  
       - **For Price Prediction and Market Analysis**: XGBoost or Random Forest.  
     - **Image Processing**:  
       - OpenCV and TensorFlow/Keras for disease detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  
       - Pretrained models like ResNet or EfficientNet for fine-tuning.  

---

### **4. Database**
   - **Purpose**: Store user data, historical production data, market data, and results.  
   - **Technologies**:  
     - **Primary Database**:  
       - MongoDB (NoSQL) for flexible schema to manage varied datasets like tea production data, weather, prices, and logs.  
       - PostgreSQL or MySQL (SQL) if relational data is more dominant.  
     - **Cache**: Redis for quick access to frequently queried predictions.  
     - **Data Warehousing**: Apache Hive or Snowflake for large-scale data storage and analytics (optional for advanced use cases).

---

### **5. Deployment and DevOps**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures scalability, availability, and ease of updates.  
   - **Technologies**:  
     - **Containerization**: Docker to package applications for consistent environments.  
     - **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for deploying ML models and scaling backend.  
     - **Cloud Platforms**:  
       - AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting (use services like AWS S3 for storage, AWS SageMaker for ML, and AWS Lambda for serverless functions).  
       - Firebase (if lightweight hosting and authentication is sufficient).  
     - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated deployment pipelines.  

---

## **Workflow of the System**
1. **User Input**: Users upload tea leaves images or input historical data via the UI.  
2. **API Request**: Frontend sends the data to the backend.  
3. **Preprocessing**: Backend validates and preprocesses the data.  
4. **Prediction**:  
   - Data is sent to appropriate ML models:  
     - Foreign exchange prediction → Time-series models.  
     - Market analysis → Classification models.  
     - Disease detection → CNN image classification.  
     - Price prediction → Regression models.  
5. **Results Storage**: Predictions are cached and stored in the database for future reference.  
6. **Visualization**: Results are sent back to the UI for user-friendly display.
