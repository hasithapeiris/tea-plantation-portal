**Research Component:**

“Develop a model to **predict the foreign exchange earnings from tea exports** and propose a strategic **production plan** to maximize these earnings.”

**Specific Objectives:**

1. **Predicting Annual Tea Production: ✅**

- Low Grown, Medium Grown, High Grown, Climatic Changes

2. **Forecasting Foreign Exchange Earnings: ✅**

- Past Tea Production, Export Volumes, Export Prices, Exchange Rates

3. Providing Infographic Charts:

- Future Production Levels, Foreign Exchange Earnings

4. Providing a Production Plan:

- Low Grown, Mid Grown High Grown

**Data Requirements:**

1. **Tea Production Data ✅**
2. **Tea Exports Data ✅**
3. **Foreign Exchange Rates Data ✅**
4. Weather Data (optional)

**Progress up to now (50% completed):**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

- Web Crawling, Government Databases
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)

2. **Predictive Modeling:**

- Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ARIMA
- Python (Scikit-learn)

3. **Model Optimization and Evaluation:**

- Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error (Scikit-learn)

4. **Implementation and Testing:**

- Python (Flask), Node.js (Express.js, React.js)

**Demo:**  
**What is to be done?**

1. Simulate and find the best production volumes using the trained FEE prediction model (Grid Search, Gradient-Based Optimization).

2. Provide decision-making support tools that suggest adjustments in production volumes.

3. Implement a dashboard for stakeholders to view the forecasted foreign exchange earnings and recommended production volumes.

4. Implement visualization and report generation tools.
