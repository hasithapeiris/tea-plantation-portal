Consider this scenario,

A user enters input features as:
1. Date (Year, Month):
2. Production Quantities (High, Medium, Low):
3. Export Quantity:
4. Export Price:
5. Exchange Rate:

He wants to know the best production volumes of each growing area to maximize the Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEE). 

Then how should the model implementation be done?
