The problem has two distinct goals:

1. **Predicting Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEE)**: Estimating earnings based on tea production, export quantities, and exchange rates.
2. **Optimizing Production Volumes**: Finding the optimal production quantities by elevation (High, Medium, Low) to maximize FEE.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the model:

---

### **1. Data Preparation**

#### **Combine Datasets**

You need a unified dataset where rows represent a time point (e.g., Year-Month) and columns include all relevant features:

- **Tea Exports Data**:
  - Sum `Quantity` and `Price` for all categories per month (if needed for aggregation).
- **Tea Production Data**:
  - Aggregate production data for High, Medium, and Low elevations.
- **Exchange Rate Data**:
  - Calculate an average rate for each month from the buy/sell rates.

**Unified Dataset Structure**:
| Year-Month | Exported Quantity | Average Export Price | High Grown Quantity | Medium Grown Quantity | Low Grown Quantity | Avg Exchange Rate | FEE |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----|

- **Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEE)** can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{FEE} = \text{Exported Quantity} \times \text{Average Export Price} \times \text{Avg Exchange Rate}
  \]

#### **Feature Engineering**

- Add lag features to capture trends:
  - Lagged production quantities (e.g., High Grown t-1, t-2).
  - Lagged export quantities and prices.
  - Lagged exchange rates.
- Add ratios:
  - Exported quantity as a fraction of production.
  - Export price changes over time.

### **2. Model for Predicting Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEE)**

- **Approach**: Use a **regression model** to predict FEE based on the unified dataset.
- **Model Choices**:
  - Linear Regression (Baseline)
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
  - Neural Networks (if the dataset is large enough)

#### **Training Process**:

- **Input Features**:
  - Production quantities (High, Medium, Low).
  - Export quantities and prices.
  - Exchange rates (current and lagged).
- **Output**:
  - Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEE).
- **Evaluation**:
  - Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

### **3. Optimization for Production Volumes**

- Use the trained FEE prediction model to simulate and find the best production volumes.

#### **Approach**:

- Define the **optimization objective**: Maximize predicted FEE.
- Use optimization algorithms like:
  - **Grid Search**: Try combinations of High, Medium, and Low production volumes.
  - **Gradient-Based Optimization**: Use methods like gradient ascent (if the FEE model is differentiable).
  - **Genetic Algorithms**: Useful for non-differentiable or complex models.
- **Constraints**:
  - Total production should not exceed realistic limits.
  - Proportion of production across elevations may need constraints based on historical patterns.

---

### **4. Do You Need Multiple Models?**

You may need two types of models:

1. **Predict FEE**:
   - Regression model with input features as described above.
2. **Simulate Optimal Production**:
   - Use the FEE model within an optimization loop.

Alternatively, you can combine both into one solution by framing the optimization as a **reinforcement learning (RL)** problem:

- States: Current production levels.
- Actions: Adjust production levels.
- Rewards: Predicted FEE.

---

### **5. Implementation**

#### Tools to Use:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Modeling**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, or TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Optimization**:
  - Scipy.optimize for gradient-based methods.
  - Pyomo or Genetic Algorithm libraries for advanced optimization.

#### Workflow:

1. **Prepare Unified Dataset**: Use pandas to merge datasets by `Year-Month` and compute derived features.
2. **Train Regression Model**:
   - Select features and split data into training/test sets.
   - Train and evaluate models.
3. **Optimize Production**:
   - Use the trained model to predict FEE for different production volumes.
   - Find optimal volumes using optimization algorithms.

### Example Code Snippets

#### **Unified Dataset**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Merge datasets by Year-Month
exports = pd.read_csv("exports.csv")
production = pd.read_csv("production.csv")
exchange_rates = pd.read_csv("exchange_rates.csv")

# Aggregate and preprocess
exports['FEE'] = exports['Quantity'] * exports['Price'] * exports['Exchange Rate']
merged_data = pd.merge(exports, production, on='Year-Month')
merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, exchange_rates, on='Year-Month')

# Lag features
for lag in range(1, 4):  # Lag 1 to 3 months
    merged_data[f'High_Grown_Lag_{lag}'] = merged_data['High_Grown_Quantity'].shift(lag)
```

#### **Model Training**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

# Features and target
X = merged_data.drop(columns=['FEE'])
y = merged_data['FEE']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = XGBRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### **Optimization**

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Objective function: Predict FEE for given production volumes
def objective(production_volumes):
    data = X_test.copy()
    data['High_Grown_Quantity'] = production_volumes[0]
    data['Medium_Grown_Quantity'] = production_volumes[1]
    data['Low_Grown_Quantity'] = production_volumes[2]
    return -model.predict(data).mean()  # Negative for maximization

# Constraints
bounds = [(100, 1000), (100, 1000), (100, 1000)]  # Example bounds
result = minimize(objective, [500, 500, 500], bounds=bounds)
optimal_production = result.x
```
